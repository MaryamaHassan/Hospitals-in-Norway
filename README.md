### Summary
The project is a detailed analysis of the hospital trusts in Norway, examining their establishment years, employee distribution, and regional classification. Using Pythonâ€™s data manipulation and visualisation libraries (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`), the project compiles and explores data for 18 hospital trusts. The analysis includes various attributes such as hospital names, locations, main campuses, years of establishment, the number of employees, and the directors. The study also provides an overview of the regional health authorities overseeing these trusts, offering a structured perspective on how healthcare resources are distributed across Norway.

Visualisations, including bar charts and count plots, reveal key insights such as the trend of hospital trust establishments peaking in 2001-2002 and the dominance of the Southern and Eastern Norway region in terms of staffing. This region has the highest number of employees, primarily due to Oslo University Hospital, which alone employs over 24,000 people, highlighting its significance as a medical and research hub.

### Conclusion
This analysis successfully uncovers the organisational landscape of Norway's healthcare system, demonstrating how resources and personnel are allocated across different regions. The data indicates a concentration of healthcare infrastructure in Southern and Eastern Norway, reflecting the strategic importance of Oslo and its central role in medical research and services.

The project underscores the value of data visualisation in presenting complex health data effectively, making it an impactful addition to a professional portfolio. It can serve as a foundational analysis for anyone interested in regional healthcare planning or looking to explore how data-driven decisions can optimise resource distribution in the healthcare sector.
